            <div class="experience">
                <h3>Maintenance Engineer Intern at Schweitzer-Mauduit International</h3>
                <p>As a Maintenance Engineer Intern at Schweitzer-Mauduit International in 
                    Ancram, NY, I contributed to diagnosing and repairing equipment, integrating 
                    modern technologies into legacy systems, and optimizing operational efficiency. 
                    My key projects included designing a semi-automated rope feed system to
                     replace manual processes, developing a product packaging line that boosted speed 
                     by 25% while reducing physical strain, and redesigning a pneumatic press with 
                     enhanced safety features. I also integrated advanced sensor technology to 
                     improve equipment safety and efficiency. Throughout, I maintained meticulous 
                     documentation using tools like Excel, Oracle, AutoCAD, and Word for planning, 
                     schematics, and procedural guides.</p>

                <h3>SWM Rope-Stretch</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a semi-automated rope feed system to replace the manual
                    winding process on the paper machine, improving both efficiency and operator
                     safety. The system featured a series of rollers and tensioners to ensure consistent
                      rope feed, reducing downtime and labor intensity. Using AutoCAD, I developed
                     detailed schematics and part diagrams for fabrication, collaborating closely
                      with the maintenance team to integrate the system seamlessly with existing
                      equipment. Throughout the project, I maintained thorough documentation,
                     including BOMs, schematics, and operational procedures, to facilitate future
                      maintenance and system improvements.</p>

                <h3>Jeep Restoration</h3>
                <p>Undertaking a complete restoration of a 1946 Willys Jeep CJ-2A, focusing on both 
                    mechanical and electrical components. The drivetrain was fully rebuilt, involving 
                    complete disassembly, replacement of worn parts, and reassembly to factory 
                    specifications. The body and frame restoration included repairing structural 
                    damage through welding, fabricating missing sections, and rebuilding the wiring 
                    harness to ensure proper electrical functionality.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Robotic Dog Project</h3>
                <p>Developed a quadruped robotic dog platform to explore dynamic motion control and 
                    autonomous navigation. The project involved designing a lightweight yet robust 
                    mechanical structure while performing kinematic analysis to optimize joint 
                    articulation and stability. I integrated an embedded control system using a 
                    Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers to process sensor data and execute movement 
                    commands. Implementing inverse kinematics algorithms enabled stable walking and 
                    obstacle avoidance, enhancing the robotâ€™s autonomous capabilities. Additionally, 
                    I designed a user interface for remote operation and documented the system 
                    architecture to support future developments and improvements.</p>

                <h3>ASME - American Society of Mechanical Engineers</h3>
                <p>As the Team Lead of the electric-Human Powered Vehicle Challenge for ASME at Embry-Riddle 
                    in 2023, I oversaw the design and development of a Class-I electric trike. I 
                    managed the project by dividing the design process into specialized teams, 
                    appointing team leads to ensure efficient workflow and collaboration. My contributions 
                    included designing the roll cage, performing FEA simulations in Fusion 360 to 
                    validate structural integrity, and coordinating with the school welder for 
                    fabrication. Additionally, I assisted in selecting and sizing the motor and battery 
                    to meet competition regulations.</p>

                <p>As a volunteer at Embry-Riddle's Eagle Flight Research Center (EFRC), I gained hands-on 
                    experience in the engineering design process while contributing to cutting-edge research 
                    initiatives. I designed and built a test apparatus to evaluate a fire suppression gel 
                    for an electric aircraft battery pack, ensuring compliance with safety and performance 
                    standards. I regularly provided project updates to EFRC leadership, incorporating feedback 
                    to drive improvements. Additionally, I authored and submitted white papers detailing project 
                    requirements and methodologies to begin projects and secure funding.</p>
